# **Acrylic Sheet Clamp for Tubing – 12–15mm Flexible Tube Holder**

![Clamp Preview](Clamp.png)

## Overview

This CAD model represents a **flexible acrylic/3D-printable clamp** designed to securely hold **silicone or soft rubber tubes with 12–15 mm outer diameter**. The clamp can be fastened to **aluminum extrusions or 3D-printed parts** using **M3 screws**, making it ideal for clean and modular tube routing in robotic, laboratory, and prototyping assemblies.

## Purpose and Application

This clamp is part of the **tube-management subsystem** used in robotic, pneumatic, and fluid-handling setups. It was developed to support stable and organized tube routing where soft tubing must be mounted without deformation or slippage.

By providing a secure and flexible grip, the clamp helps maintain consistent tube paths, reduces vibration, and minimizes the risk of kinks or accidental detachment—beneficial in high-precision automation and experimental environments.
